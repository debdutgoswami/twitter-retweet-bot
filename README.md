# Twitter Retweet Bot

I made a simple twitter bot which will retweet tweets with the specified hashtag. This was my first attempt of creating a twitter bot. It is obviously not perfect and there is room for lots of imprvements which I will do eventually with time.

# Instruction

## Getting the right libraries

To install the necessary libraries run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in the terminal.

## Running the Bot

To run the bot first you need to run the ```main.py``` script. To do that type ```python3 main.py``` in terminal and then enter the hashtag as input.

# Usefulness

This Bot can be used by influencers to get followers or likes (mainly applicable for wannabe instagram influencers)


# Ideas

1. This same technique can be used in almost any social media sites, like Instagram, Facebook, etc. You just need to be careful with the checks the websites perform to determine wheter a user is a real person or a Bot.

2. You can keep this bot running overnight or create a VM in and Cloud Platform and keep it running always (mind the bill :p).
